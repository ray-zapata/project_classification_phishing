### I. Project Overview
---

#### 1. Description

One of the biggest internal problems with any company relying on electronic communications is employees falling victim to phishing schemes to obtain private, personal, and sensitive information. These attempts make every individual in the workforce a potential vector for information leaks that would result in server failures, customer data compromise, and operation security breaches.

#### 2. Deliverables

- Jupyter [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ray-zapata/project_classification_phishing/blob/main/phishing_report.ipynb) containing findings, summary, and process through data science pipeline
- Trello [board](https://trello.com/b/Zl97PmXz/phishing-classification) demonstrating process and planning
- This [README](#using-url-composition-to-predict-phishing-attempts) containing project summary, goals, and findings
- Project summary for resum√© and portfolio

### II. Project Summary
---

#### 1. Goals

The goal of this project is to create a classification model that is capable of maximizing the capture of phishing attempts utilizing only the composition of a Universal Resource Locator (URL), also known colloquially as a web address, while minimizing instances of false negatives that may result in productivity loss.

#### 2. Initial Thoughts & Hypothesis

Throughout the initial phases of this project, the working hypothesis was that the length in characters and the count of special characters, such as dots (`.`) and hyphens (`-`), would be a strong use in phishing predictions. Annecdotal evidence suggests phishing attempts most frequently make use of subdomains and high path levels to mask the underlying hostname as a legitimate source (i.e. `http://https.apple.com.nz/apple-id-password/&2993%?dds99kdjf`)

#### 3. Findings & Next Phase

There would prove to be some legitimacy to the above hypotheses, as modeling would utilize recommended features that included these special characters as well as the path level. It was also found that by using clustering methodology to create groupings based on the number of dots to the number of dashes showed statistically significant sample means different from the population mean using analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing.

In modeling, the most successfully train fitted model was a random forest model that produced results which capture nearly 90% of positive class for the target is_phishing_attempt. This model maintained an above 78% overall accuracy throughout creation, evaluation, and testing.

With additional time, it would be worthwhile to use analysis of the web page HTML to find any frequent elements common among illegitimate links. For the purpose of internal security, in actual application a machine dedicate to rendering the pages in question would be the best course of action to prevent shadow installation of common malware or other malicious software.

### III. Data Context
---

The data utilized throughout this project was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shashwatwork/phishing-dataset-for-machine-learning). This data was collected by [*Choon Lin Tan*](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h3cgnj8hft/1) and prepared for machine learning by Kaggle user *Shashwat Tiwari*. The data has been prepared in a manner that makes significant acquire and preparation unnecessary; however, much of the initial data will be unused to achieve the goals of this project.
